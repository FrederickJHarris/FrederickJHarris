- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FrederickJHarris
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in writing Win32 tutorials and providing sample code for those wishing to get started on that topic.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GitHub so as to further that idea.  Also, I do have a lifetime of code to share, and I'm happy to do so.
I'm a retired forester from the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry.  During the 20 years I worked there I coded all their desktop systems in PowerBASIC and C++,
and their handheld systems in eMbedded Visual C++. I can be reached at frederick j harris 01 at gmail . com.  There are no spaces in that email address and
the '01' is zero one, not Oh 'O' one.
